### 3.1 Functions and Function Notations

- The relation: a set of ordered pairs such as
$$ \lbrace (1, 2), (2, 4), (3, 6), (4, 8), (5, 10) \rbrace $$
where the domain is $\lbrace 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \rbrace$ and the range is $\lbrace 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 \rbrace$.

- The input (or independent variable) $x$
$$ x \in \text{domain} $$

- The output (or dependent variable) $y$
$$ y \in \text{range} $$

- The function $f$: a relation that assigns a exactly one element in the range to each element in the domain.
