### 4.1 Linear Functions

- The linear function (slope-intercept form)
$$ f(x) = mx + b $$
where $m$ is the constant rate of change (or slope), $b$ is the value at $x = 0$, so the $y$-intercept is at $(0, b)$.

- For a linear function $f(x) = mx + b$
    - if $m > 0$, the $f(x) = mx + b$ is an increasing function
    - if $m < 0$, the $f(x) = mx + b$ is a decreasing function
    - if $m = 0$, the $f(x) = mx + b$ is a constant function

- For the linear function $f(x)$ that passes two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$, its slope $m$ can be calculated as
$$ m = \dfrac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \dfrac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \dfrac{f(x_2) - f(x_1)}{x_2 - x_1} $$
and the lienar equation is
$$ y = m(x - x_1) + y_1 $$

- For two lines $f(x) = m_1 x + b_1$ and $g(x) = m_2 x + b_2$, they are parallel if
$$ m_1 = m_2, \; b_1 \neq b_2 $$

- For two lines $f(x) = m_1 x + b_1$ and $g(x) = m_2 x + b_2$, they are perpendicular if
$$ m_1 \cdot m_2 = -1 $$
