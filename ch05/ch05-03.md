### 5.3 Graphs of Polynomial Functions

- If a polynomial contains a factor of the form $(x âˆ’ h)^p$, the behavior near the $x$-intercept $h$ is determined by the power $p$. We say that $x = h$ is a root (or zero) of multiplicity $p$.

- The graph of a polynomial function will touch the $x$-axis at roots (or zeros) with even multiplicities. The graph will cross the $x$-axis at roots (or zeros) with odd multiplicities.

- The sum of the multiplicities is the degree of the polynomial function.

- Let $f$ be a polynomial function. The Intermediate Value Theorem states that if $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ have opposite signs, then there exists at least one value $c$ between $a$ and $b$ for which $f(c) = 0$.

- The factored form of polynomials
$$f(x) = a(x - x_1)^{p_1}(x - x_2)^{p_2} \cdots (x - x_n)^{p_n}$$
where the polynomial function has $x$-intercepts at $x = x_1, x_2,  \dots, x_n$.
