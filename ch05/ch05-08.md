### 5.8 Modeling Using Variation

- The direct variation (or the direct proportion): the relationship between $x$ and $y$ that satisfies 
$$ y = k x^n$$
where $k, n \in \mathbb{R}$, $k \neq 0$, and $n > 0$. Here, $k = \dfrac{y}{x^n}$ is called as the constant of variation.


- The inverse variation (or the inverse proportion): the relationship between $x$ and $y$ that satisfies 
$$ y = \dfrac{k}{ x^n} $$
where $k, n \in \mathbb{R}$, $k \neq 0$, and $n > 0$.

- The joint variation: when a variable varies directly or inversely with multiple variables. For example,
$$ x = kyz, \; x = \dfrac{ky}{z} $$
