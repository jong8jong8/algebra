### 5.4 Dividing Polynomials

- The Division algorithm
$$ f(x) = d(x) q(x) + r(x) $$
where 
    - $f(x)$ is a given polynomial dividend of degree $d_f$
    - $d(x)$ is an polynomial divisor of degree $d_d$. Here, $d(x) \neq 0$ and $d_d \leq d_f$
     - There exist unique polynomial $q(x)$  of degree $d_q$ and $r(x)$ of degree $d_r$ such that
$$ f(x) = d(x)q(x) + r(x) $$
where $q(x)$ is the quotient and $r(x)$ is the remainder.
    - If $r(x) \neq 0$, then $d_r < d_d$.
    - If $r(x) = 0$, then $d(x)$ and $q(x)$ are factors of $f(x)$.
