### 5.4 Dividing Polynomials

- The Division algorithm
$$ f(x) = d(x) q(x) + r(x) $$
where 
    - $f(x)$ is a given polynomial dividend of degree $n_f$
    - $d(x)$ is an polynomial divisor of degree $n_d$. Here, $d(x) \neq 0$ and $n_d \leq n_f$
     - There exist unique polynomial $q(x)$  of degree $n_q$ and $r(x)$ of degree $n_r$ such that
$$ f(x) = d(x)q(x) + r(x) $$
where $q(x)$ is the quotient and $r(x)$ is the remainder.
    - If $r(x) \neq 0$, then $n_r < n_d$.
    - If $r(x) = 0$, then $d(x)$ and $q(x)$ are factors of $f(x)$.
    


- ðŸŽ¯ `jupyter-lab` practice
    - See **sympy.org**: [div, quo, rem](https://docs.sympy.org/latest/modules/polys/reference.html?highlight=div#sympy.polys.polytools.div)

```
# Example 1

from sympy import symbols, div, quo, rem

x = symbols('x')

dividend = 5*x**2 + 3*x - 2
dividend

divisor = x + 1
divisor

quotient, remainder = div(dividend, divisor)

quotient

remainder

q = quo(dividend, divisor)
q

r = rem(dividend, divisor)
r
```

- Synthetic division is a shortcut that can be used when the divisor is a binomial in the form $x âˆ’ k$ where $k \in \mathbb{R}$.
